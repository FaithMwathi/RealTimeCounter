# 📝 Real-Time Character Counter

A simple and responsive real-time character counter built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This tool updates the number of characters typed in an input or textarea field, live as the user types.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time character count update
- Clean and responsive UI
- Written in plain JavaScript (no libraries)

## 💡 How It Works

The character counter listens for the `input` event and updates the count based on the text entered. If a maximum limit is set, it shows remaining characters and highlights when the user is close or over the limit.
